app/routers/match.py

/match          — full pipeline, blocking single call. No cancellation once
                  it starts (kept for simple/scripted use — the CLI and
                  Swagger docs use this one).
/match/start    — same pipeline, but runs in a background thread and returns
                  a job_id immediately. This is what the frontend uses, so it
                  can poll for progress and genuinely cancel mid-search.
/match/{id}       — poll for a job's current status/progress/results.
/match/{id}/cancel — request cancellation. Stops before the NEXT batch is
                    sent; a batch already in flight to Claude/OpenAI still
                    completes (can't recall a request already sent), but no
                    further batches after it will be queued.

These are the only files that import matching_service — /listings never
does, which is what guarantees "Browse all" can never call the AI.
