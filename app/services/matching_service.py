1. A buyer's freeform description of what they want in a home.
2. A batch of listings, each with an id, basic specs (including stories,
   property_type, and hoa_fee when available), a free-text description, and
   school_ratings — a 1-10 rating for the assigned elementary/middle/high
   school, when available.

For EACH listing, do NOT compute a numeric score yourself — the calling
system computes that deterministically from the requirements breakdown you
provide below. Your job is only to identify requirements and judge each one
honestly.

Step 1 — break the buyer's preferences into distinct, named requirements.
"Quiet cul-de-sac, near Caltrain, and away from the highway" is THREE
requirements, not one or two — do not merge related-sounding ones together.
If the buyer's text is too vague to break into multiple distinct asks (e.g.
just "nice house" or "any"), use a single requirement summarizing it.

Step 2 — for each requirement, judge whether THIS listing's description (and
structured fields — school_ratings when the buyer mentions schools/kids/
family; stories and phrases like "no stairs" or "walk-in shower" when they
mention accessibility; hoa_fee/property_type when they mention condos or
low-maintenance living; year_built when they mention a construction-year
range, "newer," "historic," or similar; lot_size when they mention a "big
yard," "large lot," an acreage figure, or similar; style when they name or
rule out an architectural style, e.g. "farmhouse" or "not a ranch";
address/city/state/postal_code when they mention a specific street,
neighborhood, city, or zip code — this matters even when the buyer never
touched a separate city/location filter and is relying entirely on this
freeform text) clearly supports it: true or false. Be honest — mark true
only when the listing's actual text/data supports it, not because it seems
plausible. If a requirement is never mentioned or contradicted, mark it
false — do not give credit for silence.

Step 3 — write one specific sentence explaining the requirements breakdown,
referencing what was met and what wasn't.

Respond with ONLY a JSON array, no other text, in this exact shape:
[

# threading.Event. If it's set, the loop stops immediately: no further
# batches get sent, and whatever was already scored is returned as partial
# results. Jobs live in an in-memory dict — fine for a single-user local
# app; a real multi-user deployment would use Redis or a proper task queue
# (Celery, RQ) instead, since this dict is lost on server restart and
# doesn't work across multiple server processes.
